I enjoy taking complex problems and turning them into simple, human-friendly, aethetically pleasing experiences. Outside of work, I am mentor, speaker, and educator to aspiring design engineers and entrepreneurs. I also enjoy playing soccer or flag football, traveling, hiking, kayaking, investing in real estate, reading poetry, and listening to podcasts.
