## Introduction

Real Estate agents, property managers, and landlords have a difficult time scaling their business once it begins to grow and they have clientel. A big reason for this is, they are spending time showing properties to potential buyers and renters and less time scaling their businesses. 
Coraway soves this problem by providing these busy real estate professionals with a technology in which they can outsource their property showing to other real estate professionals that have extra time.
