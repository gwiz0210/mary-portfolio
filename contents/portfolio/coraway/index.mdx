## Introduction
This prototype was a side project to explore ways real estate investors can connect with each other and grow their portfolios more efficiently. The idea came to mind as I was managing some out of state properties from across the country, in a different time zone. Although I had a community of friends and family in the area, there were times I wished I had a more experienced local investor, equally as passionate about real estate to act as my boots on the ground in certain situations. 

I am able to network with investors online using facebook groups and forums such as BiggerPockets, but what if there was a more intelligent, streamlined way to connect with like-minded individuals? Less work, more effective and automated. Dating apps are already utilizing similar algorithms, why not in a niche industry like real estate?
