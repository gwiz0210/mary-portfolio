## Introduction

This prototype was a side project to explore an alternative way to find and hire a property management company. I experienced the pain point firsthand when I first started renting my property on Airbnb in 2017. I had an unreliable property manager through a referral and was looking to make a switch. After hours of reading through reviews on the internet and phone calls(answered and unanswered) I finally found a property manager I could trust. 

I couldn't help but think: Is there a way I could've improved my experience? Could I have automated this entire process? What if I could compare property managers or other real estate professionals online, the same way I would a car or house? I took pen to paper and started documenting my pain points and journey.

Users can filter based on the type of services you need. If you're interested, immediately send the manager a few questions about their business and availability.
