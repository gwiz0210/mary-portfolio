## Introduction
Fluent UI (formerly known as Microsoft UI Fabric) is a collection of UX frameworks for creating beautiful, cross-platform apps that share code, design, and interaction behavior. Fluent is the way Microsoft designs and builds digital product experiences, both internally and with our customers and community. I specifically worked on Fluent UI web, which represents a collection of utilities, React components, and web components for building web applications.

I updated the components in the open-source repository to reflect new design perspectives, fixed design bugs, and implemented the dark theme so that all the components can be viewed on the website in a dark theme.

### Dark Mode Web
I worked with one core designer and engineered a custom dark theme for all the fluent components being used in SharePoint.

### Web Component Contribution
I was a core contributor to the Fluent UI component library. The components are used across Microsoft and externally to empower teams to build and share resuable, product-agnostic components that are coherent across platforms and web. We leverage technologies like React, React Native, and Web Components to achieve these goals. The goal is for applications both in and outside of Microsoft to be built faster, with consistent pixel-perfect precision according to our design language, high performance goals, and accessibility targets.

Below are a few of the many components I contributed to over the time I worked as a core contributor.
