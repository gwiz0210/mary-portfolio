## Toolkit for Guidance
Iteration is the name of the game for the initial work on Micorosoft Lists. The design kits in Figma served as the living source of truth for the product as was vital for getting the protypes ready for usability studies. When prototyping, I always made sure I had the relevant design toolkit files open and updated and the designer not to far away for quick brainstorming or collaboration sessions.
